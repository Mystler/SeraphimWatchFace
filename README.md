Seraphim Watch Face
===================

A simple watch face for Android Wear that features the Seraphim logo background. A date display is at the top.
The bottom display shows the current temperature for your location in Â°C as well as the battery levels of your
phone and watch. In order to reduce battery drain, updates from your phone will only be requested once every ten
minutes and only when the watch face is shown.

Ambient mode is minimalistic and only shows a white analog clock.
